        What Design Can’t Do — Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat 
    </h1>
    <h4>Silvio Lorusso</h4>

    <p>"The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer." This is what my friend tells me, as we listen to each other’s anguished outpourings replete with VAT numbers, freelancing and short-term contracts. And that made me wonder what constitutes that role, whether it actually existed, how it vanished and what replaced it. Trying to answer these questions, I’d like to focus on graphic design as it is the field where I come from, and I believe it represents a paradigmatic case within the so-called creative industries.</p>
    <p>These days we hear a lot about the gig economy, the economy of little jobs, of chores. Platforms like Uber, AirBnB or Foodora are quickly becoming the direct intermediaries of any kind of service, a seemingly unavoidable development since they are prone to monopolization. Graphic design is no exception: online marketplaces like Fiverr and TaskRabbit offer access to graphic designers able to create a logo, a website, a poster.</p>
    <p>On Fiverr, whose motto is "do not just dream, do", a logo apparently costs between five and nine dollars, the same goes for an infographic or an illustration. On TaskRabbit ("we do chores, you live life") the hourly rates seem to fluctuate between 20 and 60 dollars per hour. The description of a tasker strikes me: Barbara J., $25 per hour, claims to be a self-taught graphic designer, since all her previous jobs included tasks where she created graphics. This generalization of graphic design is the keystone of my argument on its potential intellectual role.</p>
    
    <h3>Automation, Defaultism and Template Culture</h3>
    <p>Reading the recent headlines, it might appear that we have been teleported back to the ’30s, a time when John Maynard Keynes, a highly respected economist, could say without the slightest hesitation that soon weekly working hours would fall down to fifteen. This forecast is a vivid expression of the zeitgeist, imbued with a firm confidence in the advent of the "leisure society." The reduction of working hours would have been made possible by machines, able to automate an increasing number of processes.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, the hype around automation is back to its record high thanks to the advances in artificial intelligence and to an ultra-cited 2013 study according to which 47% of the jobs currently performed in the US are put at risk by computerization. The study includes a ranking of about 700 professions ordered by probability of automation in ascending order. Graphic design occupies the 161st place. Not bad.</p>
    <p>However, I think that graphic design (in which I include web design as well), has already undergone the drastic effects of automation, at least in a broad sense. The Web is full of generators capable of producing endless permutations of logos. Some of these generators make use of neural networks and therefore have the ability improve their designs by "learning" from their mistakes. But there is no need to be a Singularity zealot to acknowledge the revolutionary impact of digital technology on graphic design. In the early ’90s several desktop publishing applications found a widespread use among professionals and ordinary people alike. A few years later "photoshop" became a verb, and, together with other elements of the Adobe suite, it populated the collective imagination. The statements of the designers who were first inspired by computers are full of enthusiasm: "We are the primitives of a new technological era", the Emigre duo proclaimed, omitting that so was everyone else. At the same time, the work of these pioneers, full of proudly executed mishaps, seems to conceal a passive-aggressive form of Luddism.</p>
    <p>In his dystopian novel Player Piano (1952), Kurt Vonnegut depicts an almost completely automated society where it is sufficient to simply record the movements of a worker on a disk to ensure that the machine will endlessly repeat them with full accuracy. When I open Word or InDesign, I run into a similar situation, since the page, only apparently blank, already contains a series of design choices registered in advance, such as the margins’ width.</p>
    <p>That’s how template culture comes to life, where every new project actually derives from a long sequence of previous projects. In the mid-2000s, default settings became fashionable. Why waste time on design decisions when one can celebrate the aprioristic purity of the template? Aren’t we like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants? Perhaps, this is the most authentic expression of the idealistic impulse that permeates the modernist ideology. British designer Daniel Eatock quipped on this trend by producing a generic poster that could be used for any type of event. In this way, as it is the case in Player Piano, Eatock had done nothing but make himself obsolete.</p>
   
    <h3>Appropriation, Vernacular and Visual Relativism</h3>
    <p><Italics>No More Rules.</Italics>This is the title of the study on the influence of postmodernist mentality on graphic design conducted by Rick Poynor. During the analyzed period, ranging from the early ’80s to the early 2000s, designers subverted, one by one, all the commandments that until a short time before had seemed carved in stone. With a sans serif font, of course.</p>
    <p>Among the various trends that characterize this era, there is one that interests me particularly, and has to do with appropriation. To understand what I mean just look at the sleeve of The Man-Machine by Kraftwerk, inspired (to say the least) by Russian Constructivism, or the work of Peter Saville, who "cloned" a futurist poster by Fortunato Depero to create a cover for the band New Order. Are we in 1981 or 1932? No hope of progress is left, only an eternal return to the origin.</p>
    <p>A few years later, Tibor Kalman turns his gaze to "low", vernacular visual cultures, with a move analogous to the one made by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour in the field of architecture. It’s time to learn from Las Vegas, but also from the supermarket sign or the diner menu. The focus is now on the "design without designers", as it is phrased in an invitation to an event organized by Kalman himself.</p>
    <p>The fascination with everyday graphics, along with the historical rebounds of a growing number of designers, has deprived graphic design of any anchor. Yet again, a few years later, rules forcefully reappeared. Not surprisingly, many Italian graphic designers that have experienced the postmodern period consider it a sort of Dark Age. However, the seed of doubt has never been fully eradicated and the consequent visual relativism is a constant presence in today’s design practice. Take German designer Manuel Buerger, who went to a copy shop in Mumbai to commission the design of his own business card.</p>
   
    <h3>Intellectualization: the Writer-Designer</h3>
    <p>Perhaps partly because of this visual relativism and the democratization of tools, graphic design, at least the one produced in some avantgarde schools, underwent a process of intellectualization. A term that indicates the tendency to make writing and research the pivot of a designer’s practice. Obviously, texts penned by graphic designers are hardly a novelty: in 1963 Ken Garland wrote the First Things First manifesto while in 1978 Albe Steiner published <italics>Il mestiere di grafico.</italics></p>
    <p>The change that I observe concerns a certain insufficiency of visuality. While the texts produced by Steiner or Garland acted in one way or another as a support to their practice, new designers develop research-based projects, that often consist in the production of a text and only afterwards in the design of the artifact that will host it (maybe even delegated to another designer). Thus, several designers gradually shy away from doing graphic design as it is commonly understood, and they become primarily writers.</p>
   
    <h3>Diluted Design</h3>
    <p>As a result of the developments I described, graphic design culture has, at least superficially, become part of popular culture. Everyone knows that Comic Sans, the vernacular typeface par excellence, is a cause for mockery. While intellectualized graphic design, where one writes more and designs less, remains the domain of a cluster of enlightened schools and a few art galleries. In this case, the intellectual role of the designer is only recognized by other designers. There are exceptions, but as such they corroborate the general unsustainability of this kind of practice.</p>
    <p>In addition to being part of popular culture, graphic design has become a common practice, as in the case of our tasker who, maybe between an Excel spreadsheet and the other, had to jot down a logo or think of the layout of a presentation. According to Ian Bogost, we’re all "hyperemployed". Instead of merely practicing our official job, we perform many of them, before, during and after working hours. Tasks such as doing marketing and PR for ourselves and for our products, administering our weekly or monthly schedule, setting meetings, resetting passwords, and so on. Many of these include graphic design operations. Therefore, if we consider –and I think it is fair to do so– the replacement of a cover image on Facebook or the adoption of a new template for our blog a design endeavor, graphic design suddenly acquires the same professional and cultural value of sending an e-mail. In an episode of the Età dell’oro, a web series on the hardships of a group of creative workers from Milan, we see the art director instructing the graphic designer with a perpetual "two points on the left, no no, two points on the right". Graphic design becomes micromanagement, while the designer turns into a Kafkaesque, voice-controlled mouse.</p>
    <p>Only a few designers equipped with one or more master’s degrees, would serenely accept such perspective. This is particularly true in Italy, a country where a nostalgia for the heyday of "public utility" graphic design is still strong. An era in which graphic designers could devote themselves to major public works and thus build, establish and ultimately defend their cultural role, both directly and indirectly. Furthermore, that period seems particularly dear to contemporary designers because it was driven by a series of ideals, again linked in a way or another to Modernism, somehow easy to embrace. Values that were universal, <italics>pure</italics>, not polluted by fastidious ambiguities or contradictions.</p>
    <p>Before the advent of TaskRabbit, Italian graphic designers were already active in the defense of their professional and cultural position. The battlefield was that of unpaid competitions, such as those managed by Zooppa.com. One of the main tactics, back then as now, was to ridicule the lack of a "design common sense" of the amateur, who was guilty, for instance, of having aligned the text to the right. Poor fool. However, common sense can be seen as a time bomb within the field graphic design: as the commandment that forbids the use of Comic Sans for something that is not comical became commonplace, so have the few precepts that are sufficient to create a decent poster. And if these, together with fashionable tricks, are then incorporated into commonly used software and templates –as it happens for example with the Trendlist generator– the bomb might explode soon.</p>
    <p>When attacking non-professionals, graphic designers generally appeal to the notion of <italics>quality</italics>. Thus, they argue that the client should be <italics>educated</italics> in order to recognize it. Perhaps, it is still possible to tie the concept of quality to some specialized forms like type design or the design of wayfinding systems. Or maybe one could argue about quality with some degree of objectivity in the case of large-scale projects, such as the identity of big museums or companies. However, going back to <italics>diluted graphic design</italics>, I want to focus briefly on one case that proves the fragility of a qualitative approach and includes the developments I described.</p>
    <p>Lindsay Ballant proposed a comparative analysis of the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. According to Ballant, the communication system of Sanders, less rigid and more messy (from her point of view more "authentic") than the impeccable corporate image developed by Michael Bierut/Pentagram for Clinton proves paradoxically stronger. This is because it is able to accommodate diverse or even contradictory instances.</p>
    <p>Given the results, it seems that the real communicative hurricane of the last elections -exponentially more chaotic and “authentic” (if by this we mean grassroots) than Sanders’ one- was largely ignored by the design community. Trump’s “meme machine” seems to have played a crucial role in his rise: the memes forged on 4chan and 8chan, then “gone to die” on reddit, were finally employed by the official accounts of the candidate. As a result, they were shared and discussed globally by the most prominent media outlets under the label of the Alt-Right, and even by the official Clinton’s blog. The radical amateurish assembly of Trump supporters mixes cinematographic references, appropriations of comics, Third Reich symbols. Sometime it employs free software like Gimp or easy to use online generators. In addition, the esoteric cult that animates the production of these memes has an undoubtedly literary value, and it is not that far from complex satirical religions provided with sacred texts like Discordianism.</p>
    <p>I happened to show some Pepe memes to a group of students that were recently introduced to the world of graphic design. All of them, covertly smiling, thought mine was a joke. How could I blame them? After all, they have been exposed for months to an unspoken Manichaeism in which the simple abstractions of design are Good, while the material world, including the public and clients, is Evil. At the same time, it is also hard to blame a society that is not able to recognize the value of graphic design anymore. Clearly, I don’t speak of the carefully created design of Google, offered for free to millions of users. I refer to the long tail, populated by designers who are forced, in order to survive, to convince their client that the layout specifically developed for a website, with little resources, is better than the interface of, say, Medium.com, a superb free platform.</p>

    <p>In order to weigh the perceived economic value attributed by the public to the work of graphic designers, I’d like to resurrect the story behind the logo of Madre, a contemporary art museum in Naples. Apparent cost of the restyling: 20,000 euros. Result: popular uprising on social media accompanied by a plethora of parodies. The not-so-veiled message: "I could do that myself." Last year, following the Epic Fail of a public awareness campaign entitled "Fertility Day", the Italian minister of health asked creative workers to help out with the design of the next one. At no charge, of course.</p>
    
    <h3>Make the World a Better Place</h3>
    <p>Where to ground graphic design education, when all that concerns it appears relative? I studied Industrial Design at the Politecnico di Bari, which is certainly not known for its excellence in design. I remember one of the first days of college, when a contemptuous professor proclaimed without the slightest compassion that only a few of us would actually become designers. That made me think of <italics>Highlander</italics>, with its unforgettable "there can be only one."</p>
    <p>Although the field of design is often characterized by teamwork, competition is part of its educational imprint. An attitude that not only involves the relationship with others, but also with oneself, as students are immersed in an ocean of late nights, insomnia and self-sacrifice. An attitude that capitalizes on passion and on the idea that design is not a job but a lifestyle. At one point, among my colleagues, a novel custom spread out: in addition to friends and family, students would include in the acknowledgments of their thesis also coffee, because, as Coffee Company reminds us, "sleep is overrated."</p>
    <p>Once one is ahead of the competition, where should they devote their talent? Recently, I read a compelling interview with Ruben Pater, who teaches at the Royal Academy of Art The Hague, one of the best design schools in the Netherlands, which is in turn one of the homelands of contemporary graphic design. Answering a question about his teaching method, Pater declares that he tries "to motivate designers to focus on making great work, and while doing that, also imagining the needs and interests of the other 99%."</p>
    <p>What has been dubbed critical design is partly driven by this benign and necessary motivation. However, this attitude may lead to a curious situation: aspiring designers develop an urgency to solve an ambitious problem affecting some distant countries, while in the evening or in the weekends they might do a bullshit job, technical term coined by anthropologist David Graeber, perhaps in a call center. Basically, as they concentrate on the "other" 99%, they forget to be part of it themselves. It’s hard not to notice an analogy with the world of Californian startups, eager to "make the world a better place." And the aspiring designer, whether critical or not, doesn’t seem so different from the startupper working uninterruptedly in his basement in order to create a revolutionary product.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, both the design field and tech startups are affected by what Evgeny Morozov calls "solutionism", the idea that to solve a "wicked", social problem, a technical solution is sufficient. However, such confidence in technology and science seems dubious when expressed within graphic design, a fundamentally humanistic field whose scientific basis appears vague. Perhaps, it would be better to speak of graphic design as a <italics>language</italics>, highlighting in this way its ideological component.</p>
    <p>The fact that design is always imbued with ideology is indeed what Ruben Pater, an avid critic of design solutionism himself, highlights in his <italics>The Politics of Design</italics>. He begins the book by pointing out a series of often obliterated expressions of privilege, such as the the mere possibility of reading a text online, a benefit granted to only 40% of the world population. Clearly, we shouldn’t dismiss the denunciation of privilege as a sanctimonious do-good design attitude. And we must take into account the dramatic material imbalances within the 99%. But if it’s true that, as Tony Fry argues, design “either serves or subverts the status quo”, it is legitimate to ask whether within certain instances of design education, the impetus to subvert the status quo is precisely what ultimately serves it.</p>
    <p>Both the designer in the call center and the startupper in the garage are victims of the cognitive dissonance of what I call <italics>entreprecariat</italics>, the mutual influence between an entrepreneurial pressure, that happens especially at a social level, and an increasing form of perceived precarity, which is at the same time material, professional, and existential. Both the designer and the startupper seem to be living at the same time two parallel lives, both are divided subjects.</p>
    <p>One possible way out for the aspiring designer is exactly education. Since market dynamics rarely allow designers to develop a practice that is intellectually fulfilling, some designers aim to become teachers, tutors, guest lecturers. The protected space of the school provides the ideal backdrop for endless discussions on social issues. Referring to the master programs in creative writing, Timothy Small speaks of a big Ponzi scheme, "a process in which one writer without money begins to teach in order to supplement their income, creating 15 writers without money who in turn will begin to teach thanks to the recommendation of the first writer-teacher, and that in turn will produce another 15 writers with no money, etc, etc." I wonder whether graphic design follows the same logic. In the article, Small interviewed a young writer-teacher based in Brooklyn, who claims to have chosen to do a master’s degree to "buy two years of time to write, […] two years of the kind of life that rich people have every year, in which money would not be a problem."</p>
   
    <h3>Temporary Autonomous Élites</h3>
    <p>At the Poltecnico of Bari, where we could barely print a black and white A4 sheet, the prophecy made by the haughty professor seemed unconvincing, as we were almost certain that <italics>none of us</italics> would have made it. Since the competitive mechanism was partially jammed, we had to content ourselves with a jovial group spirit that involved some teachers and pushed us to address local issues (my thesis, produced in collaboration with two other colleagues, concerned an abandoned barrack in the heart of Bari). No need to say that, if I could go back, I wouldn’t choose any other "educational model". Years later, many of us became indeed designers, but I’m not sure I can say that we "made it".</p>
    <p>Doing design in Bari was like listening to a glitchy radio communication that we were only occasionally able to fully capture. I believe that the geographical marginality of my alma mater adequately symbolizes the current cultural and professional marginalization of the graphic designer. Therefore, I propose that marginality should be precisely the starting point of any educational project about graphic design. With such premise in mind, it would be easier to recognize the transformation of graphic design from creative work to cognitive work. This mutation, which involves many other sectors of the service economy, has a tragic implication: the war against free labor and the devaluation of graphic design is lost. Maybe a few specific battles will be won, but in a context characterized by an unceasing cascade of free content and tools, it is increasingly difficult to agree to pay even a modest sum for an intangible asset.</p>
    <p>What is to be done? First of all, we need to acknowledge the fact that having economic problems as a cognitive worker is a structural consequence, not an individual one. In the 2000s, Richard Florida theorized the advent of the "creative class", whose transformative potential he praised. A few years later, the MyCreativity group reformulated this concept pragmatically, speaking of self-exploitation, insecurity and creative underclass. We must admit that design schools contribute to populating this creative underclass. So I think it makes sense to talk about design schools as precarity factories. At the same time, however, these schools could be described, to tweak Hakim Bey’s concept, as <italics>temporary autonomous élites</italics>, since they constitute a space where one can literally buy a degree of control over their time.</p>
    <p>To what end? To organize. If gratuity is unstoppable, maybe it’s time to extend the target of criticism. Obviously, the client or the studio who does not pay is an exploiter, but the issue must be addressed at a broader level. This is why I think that radical proposals such as universal basic income, perhaps not achievable in practice or even counterproductive, are able to reframe the very meaning of work anyway. Why is the work of a mother or a housewife not considered as such? The reason is simple: because it does not produce income, it’s free. Should the struggle for income support the one against gratuity? I envision a design school functioning like a think tank. Its area of action would be the redefinition of work and the development of strategies to produce a new cultural hegemony.</p>
    <p>If I think about it, some efforts in this direction have already been made, right back in Italy. Brave New Alps, a graphic design duo militating from the heart of the Alps, has catalyzed the debate on the designers’ working conditions for years. In 2013, they formed the Construction Site for Non-Affirmative Practices. The collective produced a one of a kind investigation into the economic and social profile of those who identify as designers. The Designers’ Inquiry was launched not by chance during the Salone del Mobile, the epitome of the rich, opulent and glittering entrepreneurial design. Brave New Alps didn’t stop there and, together with Caterina Giuliani, set up the Precarity Pilot, a physical and virtual platform that includes a set of "best practices" to organize one’s career, redefine notions of success, enable cooperation dynamics, and so on. Maybe this path, the <italics>political path</italics>, is precisely the one to follow in order to reaffirm the intellectual role of the designer and, while we’re at it, of the cognitariat in general.</p>

    <h4>May 08, 2019</h4>
    <h1>I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me.</h1>
    <h2>The world is designed against the elderly, writes Don Norman, 83-year-old author of the industry bible Design of Everyday Things and a former Apple VP.</h2>
    <h4>Don Norman</h4>

    <p>More people than ever are living long, healthy lives. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the average life expectancy is 78.6 years for men and 81.1 for women. More relevant, however, is that as people grow older, their total life expectancy increases. So for those who are now 65, the average life expectancy is 83 for men and over 85 for women. And because I’m 83, I’m expected to live past 90 (but I’m aiming a lot higher than that). And these are averages, which means that perhaps half of us will live even longer.</p>
    <p>Those of us who are still active and healthy at advanced ages–I qualify–discover that we aren’t quite as capable as our younger selves. That doesn’t mean that we aren’t healthy and workable–I still have a very active job and travel on business around the world, but I have to admit that I’m getting slower and weaker, with diminished eyesight, hearing, taste, touch, and, well, almost everything physical. The number of active, healthy oldsters is large–and increasing. We are not a niche market. And businesses should take note: We are good customers often with more free time and discretionary income than younger people.</p>
    <p>Despite our increasing numbers the world seems to be designed against the elderly. Everyday household goods require knives and pliers to open. Containers with screw tops require more strength than my wife or I can muster. (We solve this by using a plumber’s wrench to turn the caps.) Companies insist on printing critical instructions in tiny fonts with very low contrast. Labels cannot be read without flashlights and magnifying lenses. And when companies do design things specifically for the elderly, they tend to be ugly devices that shout out to the world “I’m old and can’t function!” We can do better.</p>
    
    <h3>WHAT OLDER CONSUMERS WANT AND NEED</h3>
    <p>As we age, we have more experience with life, which can make us better decision-makers and managers. Crystalized intelligence, it is called, and it gets better with experience. A caveat is that we often face physical changes that designers fail to account for into their work.</p>
    <p>Vision deteriorates. The lens of our eyes harden, making focusing more difficult. I used to be able to read tiny text by holding it close to my eyes, but my inability to focus at close distances defeats that activity. Floaters and debris start accumulating inside the eye, which scatters the light on its way to the retina, reducing contrast and making it more difficult to see small, low-contrast objects. For the increasing number of people who have cataract surgery, the eye’s lenses have ben replaced with plastic, which usually have a fixed focus. (Artificial lenses that can be focused are under development.) A flashlight has become an essential item, whether the one built into many phones or carried separately, because illumination makes tiny type easier to read although even then, a magnifying glass might be useful.</p>
    <p>Hearing decreases. High frequencies are first to go, which also tends to impair directional sensitivity, which in turn makes it more difficult to attend to someone in a crowded, noisy environment. Loud restaurants are torture. So, more and more, my wife and I select restaurants by their noise level rather than by their food quality. At home while watching TV, whether shows, streaming events, or movies, we always turn on the captions, which often block critical parts of the image. Even worse, when a film shows someone speaking in a foreign language, the film often translates the words, but so too does the closed captioning, and the two are placed on top of one another, making both attempts to help the viewer completely unhelpful.</p>
    
    <h3>BAD DESIGN ABOUNDS</h3>
    <p>The problems I face are much milder than those faced by millions of aging people. With so many of us needing better devices, why are so many things still designed in ways that defeat our ability to function?</p>
    <p>Take the screen design for Apple’s phones. The designers at Apple apparently believe that text is ugly, so it should either be eliminated entirely or made as invisible as possible. Bruce Tognazzini and I, both former employees of Apple, wrote a long article on Apple’s usability sins ,which has been read by hundreds of thousands of people. Once Apple products could be used without ever reading a manual. Today, Apple’s products violate all the fundamental rules of design for understanding and usability, many of which Tognazzini and I had helped develop. As a result, even a manual is not enough: all the arbitrary gestures that control tablets, phones, and computers have to be memorized. Everything has to be memorized.</p>
    <p>These thoughtless, inappropriate designs are not limited to Apple. New technologies tend to rely on display screens, often with tiny lettering, with touch-sensitive areas that are exceedingly difficult to hit as eye-hand coordination declines. Physical controls are by far the easiest to control–safer too, especially in safety-critical tasks such as driving a car, but they are disappearing. Why? To save a few cents in manufacturing and in a misplaced desire to be trendy. Speech can be a useful substitute for physical controls, though not as helpful as proponents claim.</p>
    <p>Then there’s the aesthetic problem. When products are developed for the elderly, they tend to be ugly and an unwanted signal of fragility. As a result, people who need walkers or canes often resist. Once upon a time, a cane was stylish: Today it is seen as a medical device. Why can’t we have walkers and canes for everyday use, to help us in everyday life, to carry our packages, provide a way to sit when we are tired, or viewing some event, and yes, to maintain our balance? Make them items of pride, stylish enough that everyone will want one.</p>
    
    <h3>EVERYONE NEEDS BETTER DESIGN</h3>
    <p>Do not think that thoughtful design is just for the elderly, or the sick, or the disabled. In the field of design, this is called “inclusive design” for a reason: It helps everyone. Curb cuts were meant to help people who had trouble walking, but it helps anyone wheeling things: carts, baby carriages, suitcases. Closed captions are used in noisy bars. As Kat Holmes points out in her book Mismatch, all of us are disabled now and then. Some of us have permanent disabilities, but all of us have suffered from situational and temporary problems. When outside in the sun, the text message that just arrived is unreadable: wouldn’t it be nice if the display, whether cellphone, watch, or tablet, could switch to large, higher contrast lettering? Are elderly people handicapped? Maybe, but so is a young, athletic parent while carrying a baby on one arm and a bag of groceries in the other (and perhaps trying to open their car door). Ride-share bicycles and scooters cannot be used by people who need to carry bulky packages. Everyone has difficulty hearing people in noisy environments. Noise-canceling headphones are for everyone, not just the elderly. Almost anything that will help the elderly population will end up helping everyone.</p>
    
    <h3>THE PROMISE OF GOOD DESIGN</h3>
    <p>Jeremy Myerson, a designer at London’s Royal College of Art (and a good friend) curated an enticing exhibit at London’s Design Museum entitled “New Old,” that explored the potential for design and designers to enhance the experience of our later lives (described in this Fast Company article “Why you should be designing for your 73-year-old self). Walkers, scooters, and shopping carts for the elderly tend to lack any semblance of grace or elegance. Not so the “scooter for life,” designed by the British firm PriestmanGoode, which has three wheels for stability and a sleek pouch for storing groceries.</p>
    <p>Powerful lightweight motors and batteries promise to motorize many new things, including walkers, wheelchairs, bicycles, tricycles, baby carriages, and shopping carts. I’ve even seen electric surfboards. If these devices are stylish and useful, they will empower everyone, from the very young to the very old. Moreover, once the stigma attached to devices that look medical is eliminated, we will see more elderly adding to their activities, and more 90-year-olds surfing. One of my 90-year-old friends just started scuba diving. Age is not a barrier.</p>
    <p>Are there any other examples of promising designs for older people? Yes, but they are surprisingly difficult to find. They are so rare that when they are found, museums put on them on exhibit and newspapers write articles.</p>
    
    <h3>LOOKING AHEAD</h3>
    <p>Designers and companies of the world, you are badly serving an ever-growing segment of your customer base, a segment that you too will one day inhabit. Isn’t it time to reform: to make things that are functional and stylish, useable and accessible? Every ailment that I described that impacts the elderly is also present in people of all ages. Designs that make it easier for elderly people often are of equal value for younger people. In fact, for everyone. Help the elderly, and the results will help many more, including yourself, someday.</p>

    <h1>Design Thinking Is Fundamentally Conservative and Preserves the Status Quo</h1>
    <h4>Natasha Iskander</h4>

    <p>When it comes to design thinking, the bloom is off the rose. Billed as a set of tools for innovation, design thinking has been enthusiastically and, to some extent, uncritically adopted by firms and universities alike as an approach for the development of innovative solutions to complex problems.  But skepticism about design thinking has now begun to seep out onto the pages of business magazines and educational publications.</p>
    <p>The criticisms are several: that design thinking is poorly defined; that the case for its use relies more on anecdotes than data; that it is little more than basic commonsense, repackaged and then marketed for a hefty consulting fee. As some of these design thinking concepts have sloshed into the world of policy, and social change efforts have been re-cast as social innovation, the queasiness around the approach has also begun to surface in the field of public policy.</p>
    <p>However, most critics have missed the main problem with design thinking. It is, at its core, a strategy to preserve and defend the status-quo — and an old strategy at that. Design thinking privileges the designer above the people she serves, and in doing so limits participation in the design process. In doing so, it limits the scope for truly innovative ideas, and makes it hard to solve challenges that are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty — like climate change — where doing things the way we always have done them is a sure recipe for disaster.</p>
    
    <h3>A New Name for an Old Method</h3>
    <p>To understand why design thinking is fundamentally conservative, it’s important to look at its antecedents.  Although it is often advertised as a method that is as innovative as the solutions it promises to produce, it bears an uncanny resemblance to an earlier model of problem-solving, celebrated in the 1970s and 1980s for the superior solutions it was supposed to produce. Called the “rational-experimental” approach to problem solving, it was a simplified and popularized version of the scientific method, in much the same way that design thinking is a stylized — some say “dumbed down” — version of the methods designers use.  It, too, was enthusiastically embraced by managers and policy makers, and was invoked to reshape practices in firms and government.</p>
    <p>The similarities between the steps in the two methods are so literal that design thinking can come across as a knock-off.  Rational-experimental problem solving was built around a series of stages, each leading up to the identification of a solution. Likewise, design thinking is generally described as being made up of modes, stepping stones in the design process, with each mode reflecting a different aspect of design thinking.</p>
    <p>Rational-experimental problem solving begins with a presumption that the search for a solution starts by relying on existing data about the problem. Design thinking, in a slight divergence from the original model, suggests instead that the designer herself should generate information about the problem, by drawing on her experience of the people who will be affected by the design through the empathetic connection that she forges with them. This mode is called, in the “can-do” imperative tense that design thinkers favor, “empathize.”</p>
    <p>That is where the procedural differences between the two approaches end.  The next step in both approaches, called “definition” or “define,” is to define the problem or design challenge.  Then, both approaches move toward developing a theory about how to solve the problem or design challenge.  In rational-experimental thinking, this step is labeled the “hypothesis” phase, while design-thinking calls this phase “ideate.” Next, both methods advise trying out the proposed solution. It’s called “implementation” in the older approach whereas the newer version exhorts adherents to “prototype.” (Though similar, the latter requires more Post-It notes.)  The final step in both methods is to evaluate the effectiveness of the experiment. In both the “evaluation” phase of the rational-experimental model and in the “test” mode of design thinking, this step sets in motion the iterative aspect of these approaches to problem solving, with adherents encouraged to use the information they glean from this phase to return to earlier phases of the process in order to refine either their hypotheses and their solutions, or both.</p>
    
    <h3>Protecting the Powerful</h3>
    <p>Both design thinking and the rational-experimental approach implicitly establish problem solving as the remit of the powerful, especially when it comes design for social ends.  They turn the everyday ability to solve a problem into a rarified practice, limited only to those who self-consciously follow a specialized methodology.  In fact, problem-solving is always messy and most solutions are shaped by political agendas and resource constraints. The solutions that win out are not necessarily the best — they are generally those that are favored by the powerful or at least by the majority. Both rational experimentation and design thinking provide cover for this political calculus. They make a process that is deeply informed by social and economic structures seem merely technical or aesthetic.</p>
    <p>There has been long been a push to make problem-solving and design more open and democratic. Experiments with participatory policy design — from participatory budgeting to public consultations on policies ranging from zoning ordinances to bureaucratic reforms — have long trundled alongside more restrictive practices policy design. Likewise, designers and social innovators have sought feedback from the populations they target, and have even looked to harvest the creative ideas generated by users who have improved products by tinkering with them. However, even in these more open processes, the designer or policy maker ultimately decides which ideas and preferences are included in the solution.</p>
    <p>One difference between design thinking and rational-experimental problem solving is that the former names and celebrates the ambiguity that is a precursor to any creative design solution. In some ways, that’s a good thing. However, it reaffirms the privileged role of the designer, positioning her as the vessel through which all the implicit understandings that make it into the final design must first pass. She is the instrument that transforms messy ambiguity into the clean lines of an elegant solution.  Because the input she brings into the design process can’t be articulated, she is to some extent liberated from the requirement to explain and defend the rationale for her design choices.</p>
    <p>Moreover, because the designer herself generates the tacit understandings she uses by connecting empathetically with potential users — the “empathize” mode — whatever needs of product users and communities she perceives are refracted through her personal experience and priorities. As any ethnographer worth her salt will admit, this subjectivity is inevitable, and that is why disciplines that rely on empathetic engagement for data collection stress the importance of paying attention to the researcher’s identity and political positioning. The design thinking method does not stipulate rigorous attention to positionality, however. This omission signals that the designer, as creative visionary, is somehow suspended above the fray of bias, blind spots, and political pressure.</p>
    
    <h3>Preserving the Status Quo</h3>
    <p>The trouble with privileging the role of the designer, or even a small circle of designers, in this way is that it radically narrows the potential for innovation. The value of ambiguity stems from the array of meanings that bump up against each other when problem is still undetermined, and from the opportunities for new connections that those collisions evoke. Design thinkers celebrate these connections, especially those that span very different perspectives, disciplines, and categories of things, and view this kind of abductive reasoning as core to creativity.</p>
    <p>When the designer acts as a gatekeeper for the meanings that are included in the design process, the potential for connections becomes limited not only to what the designer views as significant, but also to the relationships she can imagine. If the design space were flung open to meanings that users and communities view as significant, we would surely read fewer stories of design interventions gone wrong — such as whimsically designed water pumps that were abandoned to rust because they were unusable, innovative distribution systems for mosquito nets that prevent most people from accessing them, and the distortionary effect of shoes distributed to the poor as a marketing pitch to the rich, to name just a few.</p>
    <p>The political dimensions of design thinking are problematic enough on their own, but the method is particularly ill-suited to problems in rapidly changing areas or with lots of uncertainty, since once a design is complete the space that the method  opens for ambiguity and new alternatives is shut down. Climate change is one such area. The natural environment is changing at an astonishing rate, in ways that are likely to be unprecedented in human history, and that we are unable to fully predict, with each new scientific discovery revealing that we have far underestimated the complexity of the systems that are at play and the shifts on the horizons may very well mean the end of our existence. Yet, design-thinking approaches, adopted with much fanfare to deal with the challenge, have offered formulaic and rigid solutions. Design thinking has allowed us to celebrate conventional solutions as breakthrough innovations and to continue with business as usual.</p>
    
    <h3>Unsuited to Uncertainty</h3>
    <p>After Hurricane Sandy caused more than $60 billions of damages in the New York region, the Obama administration launched the Rebuild by Design competition to generate new solutions for reconstruction that would rehabilitate devastated infrastructure and protect the region from the fierce storms that Hurricane Sandy and the best climate science presaged.  The competition billed itself as using “collaborative, design-driven problem-solving to help communities and cities build resilience,” a process that would allow urban areas to “overcome existing creative and regulatory barriers by cultivating collaboration between designers, researchers, community members, government officials and subject-matter experts.” True to form, the 10 teams of international designers selected to participate in the competition held numerous community consultations, where they gleaned information about what mattered most to residents in the recovery process. The design teams combined this feedback with data about the physical damage and the economic prospects of the region in several iterative cycles of design and produced half a dozen designs that were allocated funding for implementation.</p>
    <p>The lion’s share of the almost $1 billion on offer in the competition was awarded to the Big U, a proposal for a ten-mile segmented wall, made of landscaped bridging berms and moveable gates, to protect the lower half of Manhattan and the very valuable real estate locate there. Now rebranded as the Dryline and projected to cost anywhere between $1 billion and $3 billion to complete, the wall would protect the city against the ravages of storm the size of Sandy, but likely not much larger. Current projections of storm-force sea-level rise suggest that the wall will guard against storm surges only through 2050, after which point the walls of the Dryline may turn into the sides of bathtub, holding floodwater inside the city.  In the short three intervening decades, valuable real estate will continue to be built behind the seeming protection of the wall, increasing the risks to the city when the barriers are inevitably breached.  The first phase of construction on the Dryline will be in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, alongside one of the last pockets of affordable housing on the island, and the worry is that as the manicured berm adds a new public park to the area, residents — many of whom participated in good faith in the repeated community consultations — will be displaced from their neighborhoods by a wave not of water but of gentrification.</p>
    <p>In selecting the Big U/Dryline, Rebuild by Design affirmed the political, economic, and physical status-quo. The design thinking process yielded a wall, an ordinary if costly piece of infrastructure that will hold back the waters for a while and allow residents to pretend that the sea most projections believe will flood a substantial portion of Manhattan will remain in its basin. Behind the ramparts, the city will be able to hum along as usual, with the value of real estate continuing to rise, and with the poor and middle class continuing to face displacement from the expensive heart of Manhattan to the outer edges of New York.</p>
    
    <h3>A Radically Open Alternative</h3>
    <p>Happily, the Rebuild by Design process also produced a solution that might offer an alternative to design thinking as the premier vehicle for innovation. The Living Breakwaters proposal is to create a “necklace” of small islands along south shore of Staten Island, one of the areas that suffered the worst erosion effects of Superstorm Sandy. Breakwaters are generally piles of rubble, amassed to slow waves barreling to shore, but the proposal, which was awarded  comparatively modest seed funding, suggests using them to revive marine ecologies and to turn them into hosts for all kinds of life, including plant, animal, and human.  The breakwaters are constructed with concrete boxes that offer lodging for oysters, seals, fish, algae, and other marine species, and they provide a physical and symbolic platform for educational and economic engagement with the ecosystem. With its floating schools, the project prioritizes the needs of the next generation, and positions the breakwaters as part of an ecological heritage that the youngest can claim and fashion. The premise of the proposal is that the way to address climate change is not to barricade against it, but instead to embrace the change that it represents and to reimagine catastrophe as an opportunity to create a new ecological future.</p>
    <p>Both the design process and the solution itself are radically open. Residents in the area continue to engage in the design process, not as providers of feedback to designers but as lay designers themselves. They help shape both the physical elements of the solution and the social and economic projects that they support. The water hubs, envisioned in the proposal as a land-based necklace of physical spaces that follows the arc of the breakwaters, are deliberately left undetermined in the design, inviting residents to define both their form and their function. The project is radically agnostic about the water hubs, and contemplates uses in the different centers as wide ranging as a business incubator, a lighthouse, a lab for the study of wildlife, a kayak depot, and a place of contemplation. Non-human life forms also assume an active role in the process by taking up residence in the breakwaters and remolding and expanding the physical “housing” components that the project provides them, and even attracting new species to the area, with the promise of abundant food and even perhaps balmier waters. By keeping the design process open, the Living Breakwaters project deliberately resists the closure that is so characteristic of completed design thinking solutions. The project entertains the possibility that the breakwaters will have to be reinvented as the seas around them rise. In much the same way that the project shelters the young, it protects nascent ideas by providing a protected space for the on-going and collaborative engagement with the ambiguity and uncertainly that climate change creates.</p>
    <p>The aperture embodied in the Living Breakwaters project offers an alternative to the closure built into design thinking. It illustrates a design process where the designer is dethroned and where design is less a step-by-step march through a set of stages and more of a space where people can come together and interpret the ways that changing conditions challenge the meanings, patterns, and relationships that they had long taken for granted. That process of interpretation can be unpredictable, sometimes unwieldy in both form and in duration, impossible to chart, and often only visible in retrospect. But it is precisely this inchoate messiness that makes interpretation generative: the insights people stumble upon by accident or patch together on the fly not only provide the basis for innovative solutions. They also allow a complete re-imagination of what counts as a solution to begin with.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere, I have called this approach “interpretive engagement,” and have described it as a process of collaborative and wide-ranging interpretation, where participants revisit the understandings they have about themselves and others, as well as about the changing world they live in. It represents a commitment to a process with no clear beginning and end, with a goal that is often no more explicitly defined than imaging and articulating new ways to meet changes that are still murky and immeasurable.</p>
    <p>Interpretive engagement is not without tension, and the politics that shape design choices are dredged out in the back-and-forth between participants and often forcefully challenged. But this kind of interpretive engagement offers the possibility for radical innovation, not merely because the solutions it surfaces are often highly creative, but also because the solutions tend to be open and receptive to incremental adjustment. This openness extends and shelters interpretive engagement, because it welcomes people affected by the solution into the ongoing interpretive design process and invites them to amend the solution to better meet their need at any given moment.</p>
    <p>The open, continuously transformed and transformative solutions supported by interpretive engagement represent a break with traditional approaches to problem solving — whether the approach is rational-experimental or design thinking. They allow us to engage with change, instead of barricading ourselves against it.</p>
    <p>For companies, social innovators, and political actors, the recommendation to embrace a messy, inclusive process of interpretative engagement, to say nothing of championing open solutions that sustain and encourage participatory creativity with their design, may seem unworkable or profligate. But, as New Yorkers may discover, perhaps sooner than expected, the barricades that neat design thinking steps produce are no match for changes that we cannot yet imagine or fully comprehend.</p>
